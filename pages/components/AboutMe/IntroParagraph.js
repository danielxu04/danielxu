            Hi! I'm Daniel, a <strong className="text-purple-300 purple-glow">Computer Science</strong> student at the <strong className="text-purple-300 purple-glow">University of Waterloo.</strong> 
            
            <br /><br />I'm super passionate about programming, in various areas such as Web Development, Game Development, Data Science, and Machine Learning.

            <br /><br />Currently, I'm a Web Developer at <strong className="text-purple-300 purple-glow">Discourse Agency</strong>, and I'm developing a virtual Privilege Walk API as a branch of their website, using 
            <strong className="text-purple-300 purple-glow"> Next.js, </strong>
            <strong className="text-purple-300 purple-glow">Firebase,</strong> and <strong className="text-purple-300 purple-glow">Tailwind CSS.</strong>

            <br /><br />When I'm not coding, you'll find me playing piano, training in the pool, watching K-Dramas and Anime, or hanging out with friends.

            <br /><br />I love <strong className="text-purple-300 purple-glow">learning</strong> about new technologies, and building projects to bring my ideas to life. Here's some of my work:
