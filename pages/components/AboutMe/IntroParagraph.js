            Hi! I'm Daniel, a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. I'm super passionate about programming, in various areas such as Web Development, Game Development, Data Science, and Machine Learning.

            Currently, I'm a Web Developer at Discourse Agency, developing a virtual Privilege Walk API as a branch of their website, using Next.js, 
            Firebase, and Tailwind CSS. 

            When I'm not coding, you'll find me playing piano, training in the pool, watching K-Dramas and Anime, or hanging out with friends.

            I love learning about new technologies, and building projects to bring my ideas to life. Here's some of my work:
